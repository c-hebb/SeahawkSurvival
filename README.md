A Java game created to demonstrate to future high-school students the capabilities of Java in a fun way and why they should learn to code.

I created this game following a 15 hour tutorial over the course of a week as I wanted to find a way to dive depper into Java, while being able to present something fun for the eighth grade visit at my high school, in which students are given a presentation about the classes offered. I was assigned with presenting the Java and Engineering & Design classes, providing overview as to what we learn, and why they should want to join these classes. The students were intrigued by the Java game and spent time viewing the code and running the application, amazed and what can be done with computer programming.
